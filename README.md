**NutriCheck** is a comprehensive health platform that aims to make nutrition tracking and health management easier and more personalized. Here's a brief description of its features and the technology stack used:

**Features:**
1. **KCalc**: This feature removes the hassle of checking the calorie intake from food labels. By simply entering the name of the dish, the user can view the calorie content for a general serving. It stores all the dishes and their caloric values like a logbook. An added feature is the integration of a fitness API, which provides a daily calorie target and the target weight loss or gain per day based on the user's inputs and desired body type.

2. **Nutri-Calculator**: A revolutionary feature backed up by APIs specifically on food. It's a food logbook with an inbuilt calorie calculator to maintain track of daily calorie intake.

3. **WeatherBite**: This feature provides personalized food recommendations based on location and health conditions, helping users understand how to sustain in different climatic conditions by intaking a good amount of nutrients.

4. **VitalScan**: This feature allows for storing and visualizing health reports, providing a comprehensive view of the user's health status.

**Tech Stack:**
The tech stack for NutriCheck includes JavaScript for frontend development, with APIs integrated for various features. The team initially considered using Flask for backend integration but decided to focus on frontend development due to time constraints. Local storage is used to save data on the user's computer, and cookies are used as a counterpart for the backend, storing data even after refreshing the page.

**Challenges:**
The team faced several challenges during the development of NutriCheck. Integrating the APIs with JavaScript posed some difficulties, and brainstorming user-friendly themes for the user interface was time-consuming. Retaining data was a significant challenge, which was addressed by using cookies and local storage.

Overall, NutriCheck integrates with popular health apps and offers a seamless experience for users to revolutionize their discipline in health.
